CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/hd/Desktop/Motor_Control/motor_controls.ws/build/ethercat_device_configurator/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/hd/Desktop/motor_controls.ws/build/ethercat_device_configurator where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
